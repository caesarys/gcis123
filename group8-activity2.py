Description: This program has been designed to help the user in currency conversion from AED to other major currencies and also allows 
             for it to convert from the other major currencies to AED. The option to exit is also available if the user does not want 
             to convert any of the currencies.

"""
The below values are the constants that have been globally declared that will be used in functions which will aid in currency to currency
conversions.
"""
AED1 = 0.25  # to Euro
AED2 = 0.22  # to British pound
AED3 = 0.27  # to US dollar
EURO = 3.98  # to AED
BRITISHPOUND = 4.65  # to AED
USDOLLAR = 3.67  # to AED

"""
Each individual function below is responsible for certain currency conversion using the constants that were globally declared.
Based on the value the user wants, we muliply the value (money) that the user inputs with the right constant that will ultimately give the result 
of conversion of thier choice.
